To use the Excerpt of a testimonial, add the attribute ```use_excerpt=1``` to your shortcode.  To output Testimonials in a specific Category, use the attribute ```category='the_category_slug'```.  To show or hide the images next to Testimonials, use the attribute ```show_thumbs=0``` for hiding the images, and ```show_thumbs=1``` for displaying the images.

### Output a Testimonial in the Sidebar ###
* To output a Testimonial in the Sidebar, use the Widgets section of your WordPress Theme, Accessible on the Appearance Menu in the WordPress Admin.  You can show more than one random testimonial by placing a number in the Count field.  You can show the Testimonial Title above the Testimonial by checking Show Testimonial Title Note: The Title Field on the Widget is displayed above the Widget, if your theme supports Widget Titles - this is different than the Testimonial Title.

### Outputting a Testimonial Slider ###
* **NOTE:** You can view live examples [here](http://goldplugins.com/documentation/easy-testimonials-documentation/easy-testimonials-examples/ "Example Testimonial Sliders").
* Easy Testimonials Supports Cycle2!  To output a sliding widget, use this shortcode: ```[testimonials_cycle]```.
* The same properties as the list of testimonials, such as Showing the Title and controlling the Count, also apply.  To use the Excerpt of a testimonial, add the attribute ```use_excerpt=1``` to your shortcode.  To output Testimonials in a specific Category, use the attribute ```category='the_category_slug'```.  To show or hide the images next to Testimonials, use the attribute ```show_thumbs=0``` for hiding the images, and ```show_thumbs=1``` for displaying the images.  You can randomize the order of the testimonials with the attribute ```random="true"```.
* To change the timer, use the attribute ```timer```, which defaults to 2000 (2 seconds.)  For example: ```[testimonials_cycle timer="4000"]```
* To change the transition to a fade in, fade out, or no transition, use the attributes ```transition="fade"```, or ```transition="fadeout"```, or ```transition="none"```.  These features are enabled for Pro users - 'fade' is included in the Free version!  For example: ```[testimonials_cycle transition="fadeout"]```
* Supported transitions in the Pro version are "scrollVert", "scrollHorz", "fadeIn", "fadeOut", "flipHorz", "flipVert", and "tileSlide".

Acceptable attributes for ```order``` are ```ASC``` and ```DESC```. Acceptable attributes for ```orderby``` are ```none```,```ID```,```author```,```title```,```name```,```date```,```modified```,```parent```, and ```rand```. 
* To display a pager below the slider, use the attribute ```pager='1'```.  On the Widget, check the box labeled Display Pager Icons.
* To have the height of the slider automatically adjust to the height of it's content, set the attribute ```container='1'```.
* To control the number of testimonials that appear per slide, use the attribue ```testimonials_per_slide='1'```.
* To display the publication date of the testimonial, use the attribute ```show_date```.  Possible values are ```show_date=1```.

### Outputting a Testimonial Slider in the Sidebar ###
* To output a Testimonial Cycle in the Sidebar, use the Widgets section of your WordPress Theme, Accessible on the Appearance Menu in the WordPress Admin.  You can how many testimonials are shown by placing a number in the Count field - make sure you have at least 2, if you want them to Cycle!  You can show the Testimonial Title above the Testimonial by checking Show Testimonial Title Note: The Title Field on the Widget is displayed above the Widget, if your theme supports Widget Titles - this is different than the Testimonial Title.  You can control the time between transitions using the Timer field - every 1000 equals 1 second.
* Supported transitions in the Pro version are "scrollVert", "scrollHorz", "fadeIn", "fadeOut", "flipHorz", "flipVert", and "tileSlide".

### Front End Testimonial Submission ###
* **NOTE:** This feature requires the [Pro version of Easy Testimonials](http://goldplugins.com/our-plugins/easy-testimonials-details/ "Easy Testimonials Pro").
* Add the shortcode ```[submit_testimonial]``` to the area of the page you want your form on.
* Any submissions will be added to your Testimonials list, on the back end.  Only Testimonials that you choose to publish will be displayed publicly.
* Captcha support is enabled with the installation of the [Really Simple Captcha plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-captcha/ "Really Simple Captcha").
* Front End Image Submission is enabled via a checkbox on the Submission Form Options tab.

### Using Filters to Customize Output ###
* We provide the following filters to developers for customizing output even further:
```easy_t_random_testimonials_html``` -- random testimonials filter
```easy_t_single_testimonial_html``` -- single testimonial filter
```easy_t_testimonials_html``` -- all testimonials list filter
```easy_t_testimonials_cyle_html``` -- testimonials cycle filter
```easy_t_submission_form``` -- testimonial submission form

### Outputting a Count of your Testimonials ###
* To display a numerical Count of your Testimonials, use the shortcode ```[testimonials_count]``` where you want the Number to appears.
* The Testimonials Count shortcode supports two attributes, ```status``` and category.
* Supported parameters for ```status``` are ```publish```,```pending```,```draft```,```future```,```private```,```trash```,```any```.  For example, ```[testimonials_count status='any']``` will display a count of all Testimonials, excluding those in the Trash.
* Supported parameters for ```category``` are the matching slugs for the Testimonial Categories currently on your website.  For example, ```[testimonials_count category='gold-plugins']``` would display the numerical count of all Testimonials in the Gold Plugins category.
* Note: this Shortcode only displays the numerical count -- you will need to add any words yourself.  For example, "There are currently ```[testimonials_count]``` Testimonials on your website!"

### Options ###
* To control the destination of the "View More" link, set the path in the Testimonials View More Link field.
* To display any Featured Images that you have attached to your Testimonials, check the box next to Show Testimonial Image.
* To display any Testimonial Information above the content, check the box next to Show Testimonial Info Above Testimonial.
* To add any Custom CSS, to further modify the output of the plugin, input the CSS in the textarea labeled Custom CSS.  You do not need to include the opening or closing <style> tags, treat it like you're inside a CSS file.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Help!  I need more information! =

OK!  We have a great page with some helpful information [here](http://goldplugins.com/documentation/easy-testimonials-documentation/ "Easy Testimonials Pro Documentation").

= I Updated, and my formatting changed! =

Yikes!  Before 1.7.2, we were not respecting the content filter when outputting testimonials.  So, you may have to update the CSS of paragraph tags inside .testimonial_body.  For more information, contact us via our website or support forum.

= Hey!  How do I allow my visitors to submit testimonials? =

Great question!  With the Pro version of the plugin, you can do this with our front end form that is output with a shortcode!  Testimonials will show up as pending on the Dashboard, for admin moderation.  Visit [here](http://goldplugins.com/our-plugins/easy-testimonials-details/ "Easy Testimonials Pro") to purchase the Pro version.

= Urk! When I Activate Easy Testimonials, I start having trouble with my Cycle2 powered JavaScript! =

Oh no!  Check the box that is labeled "Disable Cycle2 Output".  This will cease including our JavaScript.

= Yo!  Your plugin is great - I would really like to change the size of the images that are output.  How do I do it? =

Another good question!  With the Pro version of the plugin, you can do this by controlling the Testimonial Image Size drop down menu on the Settings screen.  Depending on your website, using bigger images may require CSS changes to be made.  Visit [here](http://goldplugins.com/our-plugins/easy-testimonials-details/ "Easy Testimonials Pro") to purchase the Pro version.

= Eek!  I love everything about this plugin... but, I don't know how to use it inside my Template Files!  What do I do? =

Don't worry!  WordPress has a great function, ```do_shortcode()```, that will allow you to use our shortcodes inside your theme files.  For example, to output a Random Testimonial in a Theme file, you would do this: ```<?php echo do_shortcode('[random_testimonial count="1"'); ?>```

= Arg!  When using the testimonial Cycle widget, I get weird overlapping text.  What gives? =

You need to update your CSS.  Try something like ```blockquote.easy_testimonial{ background-color: white; }```

= Ack!  This Testimonials Plugin is too easy to use! Will you make it more complicated? =

Never!  Easy is in our name!  If by complicated you mean new and easy to use features, there are definitely some on the horizon!

= Yikes!  I'm getting a ton of spam! =

Never fear, Captcha support is here!  Go install and activate the plugin Really Simple Captcha.  Once done, make sure you have the "Enable Captcha on Submission Form" box checked on your settings, and you should be good to go!

= Help!  I'm having issues getting the Slider to work on my site! =

Never fear, the "Use Cycle Fix" option is here!  Try checking this option and fully refreshing the page (to make sure any and all caches have cleared) -- hopefully everything is working now!

= Blech!  Some of my testimonials are too tall and the text is cut off by the bottom of the slider!  What gives?! =

Ok!  We have the solution to adjust the height to display all of your testimonial!  Use the attribute ```container='1'``` in your shortcode and the javascript will adjust the height to match the content on each transition.

= Hiyo!  My customers are submitting testimonials but no images are showing up.  What gives? =

As a security precaution, our plugin only allows users to upload images of the following file types: PNG, JPG, or GIF.  If they attempt to upload a different file type, or choose not to upload an image, then no image will be attached to the Testimonial.
